# MyReads: A Book Lending App
This project is build based on [reactnd-project-myreads-starter](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)

## Install / Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# start server
npm start

# Client url: http://localhost:3000/
```

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
